# Priority coding

* There has to be priority coding since we don't process all the information
* These priority coding methods are diverse, operate at different timescales (10ms - months ??)
* The number of priority coding neural mechanisms have been small -- small number of mechanisms might underlie broad range of behaviours? 

## Forms of priority signatures

What should be considered different types of prioritization and what as the same? 

**Perceptual learning, goal-directed visual attention, salience**

* Perceptual learning
* Goal-directed attention filters out task irrelevant (but not task relevant) information?
* Visual saliency
	* Pop-out visual saliency
	* Gradation of it using (what was this one)
	* Magnitude codes
	* Gaze-based measures of visual saliency

**Higher-order object-based priority processes**

* Image memorability
* Novelty

**Talk about (six) different neural prioritization mechanisms here**

* How to separate behaviours and neural measurements that are correlated (but not causal) compared to *true* priority coding mechanisms (causal)? 
	* Rather than studies that say "When behavioural X decreased, neural Y decreased as well", there should be a more *parametric* variation of stimulus and concomitant modulation should be seen neural mechanism (Parker and Newsome, 1998) -- this is more powerful
	* Evidence for a "readout change" mechanism in LIP while studying perceptual learning in a motion detection task ? (Josh Gold 2008 Nat Neuro)
		* Another showing V4 noise correlations go down with perceptual learning? 
		* Changes in noise correlations could cause changes in the way inputs from visual cortex are *read out* by association areas (why is this interesting?). Are they saying that the private subspace changes - changing the communication subspace dimensionality - leading to a different readout? 

**A unified but distinguishable(?) code**

*INSIGHT 1*
* Population activity (being used) exists in a lower dimensional subspace (lower than the actual dimensionality)
	* Attention seems to modulate activity in low-dimensional subspaces
	* In IT, mapping between novelty and neural activity is linearly decodable -- *they say this is 1 dimensional?* (why does this imply low-dimensionality?!)
		* It doesn't! I can have 2 3-dimensional point clouds which can be linearly separable! Wtf. 

*INSIGHT 2*
* The priority modulation scales the population vector (supposed to represent identity) without changing the orientation of the vector (priority coding doesn't change the identity) -- The population vectors need to be eigen? 
	* They say modulations of population response could be large without having a large change in choices (but if it's a gain modulation, you'd get perceptual changes?) - This would be true with magnitude coding right? 
* In fig 3a, I will still have an increased d' between pink and grey clouds after multiplicative scaling. How does this explain no change in behaviour?

*INSIGHT 3*
