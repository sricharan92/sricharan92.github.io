**Hello, I'm Richard.** I am currently a postdoc researcher working with [Jakob Macke][jhm_twitter] in the Machine Learning for Science group at the University of TÃ¼bingen. My research focus is in computational neuroscience and cognitive science, where I mostly work on simulation and characterization of oscillatory and asynchronous neural population activity as a bridge between biology and cognition. I sometimes dabble in mining and analysis of other types of data. You can find out more in [Projects][projects], my [CV][cv], or our [lab website][lab].

I did my PhD with [Bradley Voytek][bv_twitter] in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. Now I miss the ocean. Prior to that, I lived in [Toronto, Canada][toronto] for 11 years. It's the place I call home, and also where I received my Bachelor's Degree (University of Toronto, BASc in Engineering Science). I was born and raised in [Xinjiang, China][xinjiang]. There is a lot of grass, mountains, and also deserts there.

My [blog][blog] is spanned by everything in my life, from musings to reflections to neuroscience to sports to science & technology to travels (to who knows what else). I ponder a lot about life and our place in this world, and I write about it. At worst, this website is a representation and a record of my life; at best, it becomes an inspiration to someone who will come back to inspire and educate me - on my journey to find mind from matter.
