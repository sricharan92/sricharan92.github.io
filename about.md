# Hello! Welcome to my blog!

I am a graduate student at the [Cognition Lab, Center for Neuroscience](http://www.cns.iisc.ac.in/sridhar/) at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/) (IISc). I work here on questions pertaining to attention, decision-making and cognition. 

I did my undergraduate studies in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. Towards the later part of my degree, I got interested in Machine Learning and Neuroscience through Coursera and an internship at [Mad Street Den](https://www.madstreetden.com/). Thus, I ended up with a research position in [Vision Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/visionlabiisc/) at IISc. 

I come from a small town called [Bhilai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhilai) in the state of Chattisgarh in India. 

While I am not doing science, I enjoy [playing](https://www.youtube.com/user/sricharan92/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=0), composing and understanding music, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32098036-sricharan), working out and meditating. 

You can find my thoughts on neuroscience, music and psychology here. Thoughts here are completely my own and will expire as I grow.
